# 📂 PBL6 Sandbox – Main Branch

This **main branch** is intentionally kept empty.  
It serves as the default entry point for the repository, but does **not** contain the project source code.

---

## 📌 Project Information
- **Project Name:** PBL6 Malware Analysis Sandbox  
- **Purpose:** A sandbox environment for analyzing malware using virtual machines.  
- **Tech Stack:** Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, VirtualBox

## 🚀 Where is the code?
The actual implementation lives in feature branches.  
- Check the [`webserver`](../../tree/webserver) branch for the Django web application.  
- Other feature branches may be added for VM agent, API, or analysis modules.

---

## 🛠️ Contribution Workflow
1. Create or switch to a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-task
````

2. Work on your changes and commit them.
3. Push your branch and create a Pull Request into the relevant feature branch (not `main`).

## ⚠️ Note

* `main` will remain **empty** and should not contain project code.
* Please use feature branches for all development work.
* This helps us keep the repository clean and organized.
